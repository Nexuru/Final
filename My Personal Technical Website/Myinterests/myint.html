              <p>Growing up, I have always been interested in computers. My interest first began when I would play games on our family computer and I quickly began to want my own personal computer. Years later, I would get my first prebuilt PC and would use it all the time until eventually it began to fail. Because of my computer breaking I looked into building my own computer and saved up the money to buy the PC parts and I then constructed it. Originally this is what got me into PC hardware and other tech-related things such as programming.    </p>

              <p> One of my favorite hobbies is photography. During my first two years in high school, I took a photography class where I learned all kinds of things about taking and editing photos. The class inspired me to start taking more photos and in the future, I really want to buy my own DSLR Camera and travel around the world taking cool photos. </p>

           <p>A couple of my favorite games are Skate 3, Car X, and the Assassins Creed series. When I was little one of the first games I ever played was Skate 3 and it still remains one of my favorite games just because of how satisfying the trick system is. More recently I got into the Assassin's Creed games and I am currently on the fourth game in the series. Even though I have only played a few of the 13 games it has quickly become one of my favorite things to play as it has an interesting storyline and there's a bunch of content in each game. Lastly, Car X is extremely fun to play especially since I recently got a Steering wheel that connects to the game so I can now I can drift around which provides limitless fun.

              <p>Similar to my introduction to photography I also took a graphic design class during my freshmen year of high school. In the class, I learned how to use Adobe Illustrator and a little bit of Photoshop. The class turned out to be one of the most useful classes I have taken as I can now create tons of cool graphics for anything I need like school or home projects. Sometimes I use Illustrator to create t-shirt designs because at some point I would Like to make my own clothing brand. The Picture on the left is a YouTube channel banner that I made a couple of years ago but never actually used.  </p>

                Another thing I like to do in my free time is skateboard. Me and my friends will often go skate around where I live, and even though I can't do any tricks I like to just cruise around. Sometimes me and my friends will even go to the skatepark to go down the ramps and hang out. About a year ago I got an electric longboard for my birthday which is really fun to ride long distances.  </p>
